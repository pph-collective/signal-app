            All Rhode Islanders have the right to live a healthy and happy life.
            We all want resources to help us and our families thrive at home,
            work, or school. But we donâ€™t all get these same opportunities
            because of where we live. This means that some communities are
            affected by COVID-19 more than others.

              the hardest-hit neighborhoods. We make this data available to
              support policies that protect the most vulnerable Rhode
              Islanders.</b

            Project SIGNAL leverages the Rhode Island Department of Health's
            multi-component surveillance system for monitoring patterns in
            COVID-19 and related outcomes. Datasets used to create the contents
            of this web tool were obtained through an approved request to the
            Rhode Island Department of Health. This web tool was developed using
            funds from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National
            Initiative to Address COVID-19 Health Disparities Among Populations
            at High-Risk and Underserved (OT21-2103) via the Rhode Island
            Department of Health. Any opinions, findings, conclusions or
            recommendations expressed in this material are those of the
